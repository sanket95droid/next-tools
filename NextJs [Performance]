## Analyze bundles
Use the next bundle analyzer to investigate the build of your app. It is another crucial solution on how to optimize the Next.Js app bundle.
Install the bundle analyzer using - npm install @next/bundle-analyzer and add the script to your packages - "analyze": "ANALYZE=true next build." 
Finally, you can run the analyzer script after updating the next.config.js file.
